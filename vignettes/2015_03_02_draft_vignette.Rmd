# Introduction

Abigail will supply the text for the introduction. It should include:

* An overview of the flux method
* How it is used
* An introduction of the specific challenge this package is meant to address (measuring rate constants for fluxes of metabolites: anything else?)


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
